# Titanic-Dataset-EDA
Python Project on Jupyter Notebook
First I analysis the three csv files, after that merge them in an ordered form.
After that I imported the pandas library and created a dataframe 'df' and run different functions like .info(), .describe().
Using these functions I got know some insights about the dataset.

After that I Check the NULL value present in the dataset and using seaborn.heatmap() library I created a visual to show the NULL values for differnt columns.


UNIVARIATE ANAYLSIS - used single column to analysis.
used value_count() to analysis and used seaborn and matplotlib to visual that.

BIVARIATE ANALYSIS - used two columns to analysis.
used sns.barplot
